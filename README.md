# Even Divisors Finder

A simple Python program that takes a number as input and prints all **even numbers** that **divide the input number exactly**. It also displays the **sum** of these even divisors.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter an integer (e.g., `24`).
2. The program finds all even numbers that divide the input number with no remainder.
3. It prints those numbers along with a message.
4. Finally, it prints the sum of those numbers.

## Example

n: 24
2 divides 24 evenly and is even
4 divides 24 evenly and is even
6 divides 24 evenly and is even
8 divides 24 evenly and is even
12 divides 24 evenly and is even
24 divides 24 evenly and is even
Sum: 56
